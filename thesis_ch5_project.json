  "content": "> Friendship, \\[the early Stoics\\] declare, exists only between the wise and good, by reason of their likeness to one another. And by friendship they mean a common use of all that has to do with life, wherein we treat our friends as we should ourselves (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives* 7.1.124).\n\n## 5.1 Introduction\n\nFollowing upon their analysis that only the wise are free, the early Stoics described a free community of free men, rooting that community in the friendships that the wise cultivate among themselves and asserting the material necessity of wisdom---and consequently of freedom---thereto. In the absence of those two virtues, they write, \"Among the bad there is, they hold, no such thing as friendship, and thus no bad man has a friend\" (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives* 7.1.124). As such, the preservation of the community lies in the preservation of freedom.\n\nTheir theorized community---and others, as we will see---resemble the image of the *ekklēsiai* constructed by Paul in Gal 5. The ethic that Paul describes in this chapter accords closely with \"common use of all that has to do with life\" and \"\\[treating\\] our friends as we should ourselves\", and in Paul's estimation it depends upon believers' prudence, their abilities to defend their own boundaries, and their use of freedom unto mutual slavery.\n\nIt bears explaining here why I have chosen to treat essentially an entire chapter rather than selected sections, breaking with the structure of the rest of this project. The use of freedom and slavery terminology is literally central to this chapter. As it occurs at the heart of this section, interpreting it will require its context on either side.\n\n## 5.1 Avoiding slavery (5:2--6)\n\nBeginning from the final command of his rhetorical story, Paul states his point as plainly as he might: \"Look, I Paul say to you that if you are circumcised \\[or arguably,\"circumcise yourselves\"\\], Christ benefits you naught.\" \\[Ἴδε ἐγὼ Παῦλος λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε, Χριστὸς ὑμᾶς οὐδὲν ὠφελήσει.\\]\n\nFirst, a note on translation: in the treatment of the paragraph that follows, I will without prevarication prefer the middle voice to the passive where it is grammatically possible. Even where the verbs are unambiguously passive (i.e. κατηργήθητε), I stipulate that Paul's words bear the semantic force of describing the consequences of voluntary actions. I have asserted in the previous chapter that a key point in Paul's rhetorical story of Abraham, Hagar, Sarah, and their children is to establish the futility of human machination. Abraham's scheming to secure a son outside of the promise God gave him had significant consequences for all involved. Hagar and Ishmael suffered maltreatment at the hands of their masters, the Abrahamic household shattered dramatically, and but for God's direct interference Abraham and Sarah would have borne the guilt of murder. Summarizing that passage, I might say that Paul warns his readers that attempts to secure the benefits of faith on one's own initiative can have dire consequences.[^1] This passage, coming as it does on the heels of that story, would draw best upon it as an argument against \"self-circumcision\" and \"self-justification\". Given that Paul is speaking to adult male gentiles who have agency in their decision regarding whether to undergo such a ritual, such a translation is in my opinion not only plausible but probable.\n\nIt's actually the case that middle/passive forms all have a hint of reflexivity.\n\nFurthermore, it bears mentioning the obvious at the outset: of course Paul cannot mean here that physical circumcision *qua* physical circumcision disqualifies one from all advantages on offer from the messiah. For one who is circumcised himself, had circumcised compatriots in the apostolic movement,[^2] claimed the metonym \"the circumcision\",[^3] and perhaps most starkly instructed Christ-followers in Corinth, \"Whomever was called having been circumcised, let him not undergo epispasm\"[^4] to assert that the circumcised cannot receive the benefits of the divine *pneuma* would border on the nonsensical. Gal 5:2--6 cannot constitute a blanket rejection or even redefinition of circumcision as such. His critique's aim is more specific.\n\nPrinciples already established will help us to understand that aim. As in the preceding passage, the second person plural verb περιτέμνησθε must have as its target the letter's recipients, adult male gentiles considering whether to \"accept circumcision\" (as the ESV has it), to \"let \\[themselves\\] be circumcised\" (the slightly wordier but better NRSV rendering), or to \"circumcise \\[themselves\\]\" (the better still middle voice rendering of the verb).[^5] For these men, Paul asserts that circumcision would constitute forfeiture of the benefits gained in Christ, those that I have enumerated in the previous chapters. They would by necessity be submitting to outsiders, would find themselves by the very nature of that act under the dominion of the elements that comprise their flesh, and would besides that scheme unto just the sort of machination that begat the son of the slave woman.[^6] Such submission to the judgment of those outside of the apostolic assemblies or scheming on one's own initiative to seize the messianic benefits apart from trust in Jesus would have catastrophic consequences: Paul writes: \"You are nullified from Christ, you who would would justify yourselves by a custom; you fell away from grace\" \\[κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ Χριστοῦ, οἵτινες ἐν νόμῳ δικαιοῦσθε, τῆς χάριτος ἐξεπέσατε.\\]\n\nWithin the logic of the epistle to the Galatians, to be nullified from Christ and to fall from grace mean to re-enter a state of slavery. Proselyte circumcision would cause enslavement. Practically, this would have consequences reversing the benefits of freedom that Paul has outlined his argument; the Galatians would face a renewed reliance upon the dominant social and ritual obligations of the present evil age, a concomitant reversion to childish dependence upon pedagogical conventional law, and finally subjugation to intrusive outsiders.\n\nPaul has calibrated this argument precisely to persuade the Galatians. More than it might be in many places, slavery would be a dirty word in Galatia. In §4.3, I invoked the post-colonial interpretation of of Brigitte Kahl to briefly elucidate the relationship between Rome, Galatia, and Jerusalem. I want to spend a bit more space here teasing that out, engaging some other post-colonial readings, and thinking through some implications for my broader argument.\n\nKahl is over-reading, but she does intuit a real complaint against co-opting Jewish law (though I think it is only accidentally anti-Roman).\n\nWhat the influencers are doing is imperial in kind: they have come from outside of the community, and upon arrival, they have deployed their own halakhic variation of the Torah as an othering mechanism whose aim is to either exclude the Galatian believers permanently or bring them into conformity.\n\nbut not on the scale of Roman imperial conquest.\n\nIf the Roman Empire were deliberately behind it, I would change my tune, but the plausibility of such a provenance has not been established.\n\nPaul portrays his readers as unable to maintain freedom either politically or morally. This isn't surprising given his knowledge of their history as recently conquered by the Roman Empire and his perception of them as ex-pagans enslaved to their passions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEverything below this line is work in progress.\n\nἡμεῖς γὰρ πνεύματι ἐκ πίστεως ἐλπίδα δικαιοσύνης ἀπεκδεχόμεθα. ἐν γὰρ Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ οὔτε περιτομή τι ἰσχύει οὔτε ἀκροβυστία ἀλλὰ πίστις διʼ ἀγάπης ἐνεργουμένη.\n\nSo, Paul has outlined a social morality meant to preserve the freedom of his readers, who had known---who in fact had suffered, intimately and immediately---slavery.\n\n## 5.2 Rejecting enslavers\n\nἘτρέχετε καλῶς· τίς ὑμᾶς ἐνέκοψεν \\[τῇ\\] ἀληθείᾳ μὴ πείθεσθαι; ἡ πεισμονὴ οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς. μικρὰ ζύμη ὅλον τὸ φύραμα ζυμοῖ. ἐγὼ πέποιθα εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν κυρίῳ ὅτι οὐδὲν ἄλλο φρονήσετε· ὁ δὲ ταράσσων ὑμᾶς βαστάσει τὸ κρίμα, ὅστις ἐὰν ᾖ. Ἐγὼ δέ, ἀδελφοί, εἰ περιτομὴν ἔτι κηρύσσω, τί ἔτι διώκομαι; ἄρα κατήργηται τὸ σκάνδαλον τοῦ σταυροῦ. Ὄφελον καὶ ἀποκόψονται οἱ ἀναστατοῦντες ὑμᾶς.\n\n## 5.2 Enslaving oneself\n\nAnd yet. At the climax of his allegorical interpretation of Genesis that has warned against overestimating the power of association with the present earthly Jerusalem and its partisans, Paul labels the space into which Jesus's sacrificial liberating act drew the Galatians as \"freedom\". By their pneumatic transformation, they have been redeemed from servitude to the powers of the present age and from slavery to the elements, leaving them capable for the first time of independent action. We see this most clearly in Paul's final deployment of ἐλευθερ- and δουλ- terminology, Galatians 5:13: \"For you have been called to freedom, brothers; only not freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; but through love be slaves to one another\" \\[Ὑμεῖς γὰρ ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίᾳ ἐκλήθητε, ἀδελφοί· μόνον μὴ τὴν ἐλευθερίαν εἰς ἀφορμὴν τῇ σαρκί, ἀλλὰ διὰ τῆς ἀγάπης δουλεύετε ἀλλήλοις\\]. The three clauses of this sentence each evince one use of freedom and slavery language, with the final appearance constituting also the fifth and final command of the sequence with which this chapter has been concerned.\n\nThe γὰρ with which Paul opens the first clause 5:13 suggests a connection to his preceding exclamation: \"Would that those who troubling you would cut themselves off!\" \\[ἀποκόψονται\\]. Numerous commentators highlight this link, casting v. 13a as a justification for the exclusionary judgment of 5:12.[^7] In his treatment of this verse, Collman concludes that Paul employs a double entendre: not only does he wish for the influencers to cut themselves off socially, but he views them as ineligible for membership in the Galatian *ekklēsiai* due to their invalid proselyte circumcisions (Gal 6:13; cf. Deut 23:2).[^8] Collman's assertion dovetails with the analysis of freedom and slavery language presented here so far: in submitting themselves to the ritual of proselyte circumcision, the influencers have submitted themselves to the political subjugation of other human beings and thereby proven themselves to be immature moral agents, or slaves. Paul's repudiation of the influencers' efforts manifests in parallels to both 5:1 and 5:8.\n\nIn the first case, ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίᾳ parallels the ambiguous τῇ ἐλευθερίᾳ.[^9] The plain dative in 5:1 is an odd, arguably archaic and poetic use that, in terms of linguistic chronology, either ἐπί+dative or εἰς+accusative are in the process of supplanting. In 5:13a, though, Paul has not trapped himself in an oddly structured sentence and can use one of the standard expressions. As observed by Jones, ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίᾳ is connected with the verb καλέω typically indicates the overthrow of a political situation in which slaves---sometimes chattel slaves, and sometimes the people in general---are promised freedom in exchange for their support of an insurrection. He does so by the adduction of a number of Greek and Latin examples: Plutarch, *Sull*. 9.457e; Livy 24.21.7, 34.31.11, 34.32.9; Tacitus, *Ann*. 4.27.1; Caesar, *Bell*. *Gall*. 8.30; and Cicero, *Rab*. *Perd*. 22.[^10] Josephus's two uses of this formula, uncited by Jones, correspond to these examples. First, in *AJ* 6.98, Josephus records that Saul rode into the city of Galgala and throughout the country calling its people to liberty \\[ἐπ᾿ ἐλευθερίᾳ καλῶν τὸν λαὸν\\] by war against Philistine subjugation. Second, Josephus's account of the accession of Claudius after the assassination of Gaius records the senate's attempt and ultimate failure to establish a government sans emperor. Josephus records that the soldiers supporting Claudius's claim bore a particular disdain for \"one of the two consuls, Quintus Pomponius...for summoning the senate for liberty\" \\[ἐπ᾿ ἐλευθερίᾳ τὴν σύγκλητον παρακαλῶν\\] (*AJ* 19.263). In both of these cases, the subjects sought a move from a state of subjugation into a state of liberty. Leveraging the formulaic ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίᾳ, Paul's rhetoric a similar effect, indicating the realm into which the Galatians moved by their trust in Israel's messiah. The Galatian's transition into freedom took place in the past from the perspective of the letter, differentiating it slightly from the examples above, but Paul invokes it as a justification for his wish that the influencers would cut themselves off from the Galatian *ekklēsiai*; they possess no right to enslave those who have been called into the realm of liberty, and they must be resisted and ejected (cf. 2:4)\\`\\`.\n\nPaul use of ἐκλήθητε in Gal 5:13a, in addition to lending this character by its pairing with ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίᾳ, also recalls 5:8, which says, \"This persuasion is not from the one who calls you\" \\[ἡ πεισμονὴ οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς\\]. The implication there was that the gospel of the influencers did not have divine backing, as Paul's gospel---which did not advocate for proselyte circumcision, per 5:11---did. This recapitulates the insinuation of the autobiographical material of Gal 1--2 that the influencers did not have Paul's apocalyptic credentials because they had not been called as he had (cf. 1:6, 15.)\n\nThe second clause of 5:13 qualifies what kind of freedom the Galatians have gained: freedom that is not an opportunity for the flesh. A verb is often supplied in the translation of this clause, but this is not necessary to make tolerable sense of the sentence. Having reminded his readers that they have been called to the realm of freedom from those who are attempting to influence them in 5:13a, Paul cautions them in 5:13b against an exercise of their liberty from political subjugation that would result in their being enslaved once more to the flesh. Presumably then the apostle recognizes some danger inherent in his message to the Galatians. In advancing their claim to freedom from the influencers, perhaps he risks promoting licentiousness (suggested by the invocation of the fulfillment of the law in 5:14),[^11] or his deliberate attempt to create a rift between the influencers and the *ekklēsiai* may exacerbate existing fractures within the group (implied by the warnings against disunity in 5:15). Practically, either of these would imply a regression to slavery to the elements.\n\nPaul negates both of these dangers by the command of the third and final clause in the sentence, the fifth and final imperative in the sequence from 4:21--5:13: \"be slaves\".[^12] In a dramatic reversal, the sort of freedom possessed by the Galatians is the freedom not to serve as an opportunity for the flesh but the freedom to become slaves to one another through love. Readers note the reversal, but tend to interpret it as though there were paradoxical.[^13] It would be so if only one type of freedom were in view, but the classification is not so simple. The sacrifice of liberty to enter into subjugation to the other preserves freedom from the moral privation brought about by the flesh in the same way that slavery to the divine is thought to do in the work of other ancient philosophers.[^14] As such, given Paul's apparent conviction that believers possess a divine *pneuma* (Cf. Gal 4:6--7; 1 Cor 2:6--16, esp. 12), slavery to one another can be analogous to slavery to the divine.[^15]\n\nThe hard disjunctive ἀλλὰ reveals the dualistic character of the choice. Their freedom may be either of these alternative---an opportunity for the flesh or slavery to the other---but Paul insists that the latter is the only choice that preserves the benefits gained in the messiah and maintains the integrity of the community. The limitation of the field of service is notable. The Galatians are to be slaves \"to one another\" \\[ἀλλήλοις\\], presumably excluding the influencers and indeed anyone outside of the *ekklēsiai* from practicing or benefitting from this mutual slavery. That this is the case is suggested by the further delineation Paul sets down. Mutual slavery must be practiced \"through love\" \\[διὰ τῆς ἀγάπης\\]. 5:13c contains the third of five instances of words in the ἀγάπ- word group in Galatians. It first appears as a participle in 2:20, where Jesus is described as \"the one who loved me\" \\[τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντός με\\]. In 5:6, the verse where the states of circumcision and being in foreskin are rejected as grounds for boasting,[^16] Paul presents \"faith working through love\" \\[ἀλλὰ πίστις διʼ ἀγάπης ἐνεργουμένη\\] as an alternative. Following this verse, it appears twice more, first in the assertion that the whole law is fulfilled in the command to love one's neighbor as oneself and second as foremost in the list of the fruit of the *pneuma*.\n\nThis culminating instance of slavery language and its pairing with the love command clarifies the progression of occurrences throughout the letter. Jesus redeems out of the present evil age (Gal 1:4), loving the believer and giving himself on his or her behalf (Gal 2:20), thus liberating into freedom (Gal 5:1). The believer, perhaps at the urging of Christ's slave (Gal 1:10), trusts in Israel's messiah. As a result, he or she shares in the Abrahamic inheritance: the promised *pneuma* (Gal 3:14; 4:6). Such a person is redeemed out of the present evil age and liberated into freedom, is no longer enslaved by the political structures of that age (Gal 2:4) or by the elements, his or her own flesh (Gal 4:3, 8--9). Jesus's act of redemption and liberation subordinates the categories of circumcision and foreskin (which had in the previous age represented both political allegiances and moral virtue) to faith working through love (Gal 5:6), the new constitutive principle of the apostolic communities. These communities reject interference from outsiders (Gal 4:21--5:1; 5:12--13a) and attempts by the flesh to reassert its dominance (5:13b) by exercising their freedom to enter into slavery to one another (Gal 5:13c), thus loving their neighbors as themselves and fulfilling the whole law (Gal 5:14).[^17] This is the eschatological ethic, a pneumatic re-enactment of the Christ's dying and rising in the community (cf. 2:20, 5:1).[^18] Paul calls his readers to stand in freedom because freedom is the space from which the fitting slavery of a pneumatic being---being a slave to the other out of love---can be chosen. Forfeiture of freedom is the goal, but it must be wholly secure in order to be forfeited.\n\nFrom here he needs to elucidate for them them the improper and proper shapes of a community with mutual slavery at its heart.\n\nBetz, Hans Dieter. *Galatians: A Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Churches in Galatia*.

Note to self: get these page numbers at the library.\n\n[^6]: And as in that final instance, their efforts would be running afoul of divine design. When interpreting Paul's further clarification (\"And I am testifying again to every man who is circumcising himself that he is obligated to do the whole law\"), Paul's interpreters have allowed endemic anti-Jewish antinomianism to color their readings. On the contrary, when Paul says \"the whole law\" \\[ὅλον τὸν νόμον\\], the most likely referent is \"the whole of the law of circumcision\", i.e. the entirety of its stipulations, including its chronological limitations. As Thiessen (among others, Nanos included) has argued, Collman has affirmed, and I have adopted elsewhere: the Galatians' circumcisions would be invalid on account of running afoul of the eighth-day specification of the covenant command. So when dominant interpretations throughout history have regarded this to mean \"the whole \\[Mosaic\\] law\", suggesting that adopting one custom (proselyte circumcision) requires one to keep a the whole of Torah, a requirement which is---it is supposed---impossible to fulfill, they have done violence to this text. Three arguments suggest this. First, Paul never asserts that keeping the whole law is impossible, and indeed describes himself as \"blameless\" when it comes to justice according to the law (in Phil 3). Second, Paul undeniably often demands that his readers fulfill certain parts of Jewish law. (Parenthetically on this point, Fredriksen argues provacatively \\[and perhaps overenthusiasically\\] that Paul himself is a \"judaizer\". Though I might quibble with her terminology, she is right insofar as he does urge his gentile readers to hold Jewish convictions about the supremacy of the Jewish God and to adopt certain Jewish ritual and ethical \\[especially sexual\\] practices, even if he does not welcome them into the fullness of Jewish cultic and moral life in the undisputed epistles). In Gal 5 itself, he argues that the double love command fulfills (note the difference in operative verb) \"every custom\" (πᾶς νόμος; as I will discuss below, this variation in phrasing is meaningful), and he emphatically urges his readers to observe that command at various points in his letters. Finally, the law at issue in Galatians is the law of circumcision, and specifically its later halakhic variant of proselyte circumcision. To read the apostle's injunctions against this variant practice as a critique of Torah *qua* legal system is to retroject later and longstanding anti-Jewish assumptions onto the avowedly Jewish apostle to the gentiles who styles himself as an expert authorized to offer authoritative interpretations of the law that undergirds that system. As a corollary: to delegitamize Torah, as he is supposed to have done, is to delegitamize himself.\n\n[^7]: F.

Betz rejects this view, seeing the γάρ as simply an indication of the next step in the argument, but the Paul's excoriation of the influencers, as well as the political character of the ἐλευθερ- language outlined in the following paragraphs, renders his reading unlikely (Hans Dieter Betz, *Galatians: A Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Churches in Galatia*, Hermeneia (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress Press, 1979), 272).\n\n[^8]: Collman, *The Apostle to the Foreskin*, 123.\n\n[^9]: Commentators have gone as far as to call 5:13a a restatement of 5:1 (Betz, *Galatians*, 271)\n\n[^10]: Jones, *\\\"Freiheit\\\" in Den Briefen Des Apostels Paulus*, 103.\n\n[^11]: Bruce argues that his call to mutual enslavement in 5:14 and the law of the messiah in 6:2 are concessions to the concessions by the apostle, as if he were simply offering them acceptable forms of slavery and law specifically contrasted the unacceptable forms offered by the influencers (F. F. Bruce, *The Epistle to the Galatians: A Commentary on the Greek Text*, The New International Greek Testament Commentary (Exeter: Paternoster Press, 1982), 241). His reliance on this sort of language in Romans 6--8 and 1 Cor 9, however, undermines this thesis.\n\n[^12]: Betz reads wrongly when he concludes on the basis of 5:13c that \"the only way to preserve and exercise Christian freedom is to exercise ἀγάπη\" (Betz, *Galatians*, 275).
